## Migration System Integration

The documentation now properly reflects that API21 has moved from:

### Before (Old System)
- Mock data in models
- GORM AutoMigrate for schema management
- No version control for database changes
- Limited rollback capabilities

### After (New System)  
- Real database operations with GORM
- golang-migrate for robust schema management
- Version-controlled migrations with up/down files
- Full rollback and migration management capabilities
- Support for both SQLite (dev) and PostgreSQL (prod)

## Key Documentation Features

### 1. Comprehensive Command Reference
All migration commands are now documented with clear usage examples:
- `make migration-create name=<name>`
- `make migrate-up/down`
- `make migrate-version`
- And many more...

### 2. Clear Architecture Documentation
The documentation now clearly explains:
- Database layer architecture
- Migration system integration
- Environment-based database selection
- Application lifecycle including migrations

### 3. Developer-Friendly Examples
Practical examples for:
- Creating migrations
- Adding tables, columns, indexes
- Handling foreign keys
- Rolling back changes
- Production deployment

### 4. Best Practices
Guidelines for:
- Safe migration practices
- Testing strategies
- Production deployment
- Troubleshooting common issues

## Next Steps

The documentation is now complete and accurate for the current migration system implementation. Future updates should maintain consistency with:

1. **Migration-first approach**: Always document schema changes through migrations
2. **Environment awareness**: Maintain SQLite/PostgreSQL dual support
3. **Version control**: Keep migration files in git with code changes
4. **Production safety**: Emphasize testing and backup strategies

All documentation files are now synchronized with the actual implementation and provide comprehensive guidance for developers working with the API21 project.
